# Dijets Improvement Proposal (DIP) Template

Before you begin, please vet your idea, this will save you time . Check first if an idea is original to avoid wasting time on something that’s bound
to be rejected based on prior research (searching the Internet does not always do the trick). Just because an idea sounds good to the author does not mean it will have the intended effect.
The best practice is to keep the big picture in context, without forgetting about the finer details of your idea proposal.

:::caution

DIPs submitted without the following format will instantly be rejected. Remember the DIPs and their strict format is there to make everyone’s life easier.

:::

## Title
Title should reflect the content of the DIP. 

 Suffix the title with a subheading of "DIP-#" Proposals will be assigned an DIP-# at the time of Phase 'Vote Pending'.

## Simple Summary
A brief, high-level summary of what the Proposal entails or what improvements, enhancements are being suggested. Summary should be a single sentence, or a bulleted list.

## Abstract
Abstract is a multi-sentence (short paragraph) technical summary. This should be a very terse and human-readable version of the motivation and specification sections. Someone should be able to read only the abstract to get the gist of what this specification does.

## Motivation
The motivation section should describe the "why" of this DIP. What problem does it solve? Why should someone want to implement this standard? What benefit does it provide to Dijets Network and Ecosystem? What use cases if any does this DIP address?

## Specification (Keep the heading and leave the section blank if not applicable)
The specification section should describe the syntax and semantics of any new feature, or change, at a technical level. The specification should be detailed enough to allow for implementation by a development team.

## Rationale
The rationale fleshes out the specification by describing what motivated the design and why particular design decisions were made. It should describe alternate designs that were considered, and explain why the proposed specification provides the most amount of net benefit.

## Considerations
All DIPs must contain a section that discusses the security and governance implications/considerations of the proposal.

Security specific implications/considerations include security-relevant design decisions, concerns, implementation-specific guidance and pitfalls, drawbacks, an outline of threats and risks and how they are being addressed, etc.

Governance specific implications/considerations include impact on revenue stream, cost to treasury, voting process, staking, tokenomics, etc.

If the proposal requires payment to a third party team, this section must contain the details of the team.
