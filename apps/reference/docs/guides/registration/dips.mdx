# DIPs

DIP stands for Dijets Improvement Proposal. DIPs are design documents providing information to the wider Dijets community, or describing a new feature for Dijets Network or Ecosystem or a request for funds from the Treasury Wallet to be used in accordance to a proposal that was unanimously passed by the Governance Council during voting. 

The DIP should provide a concise technical or in-depth specification of the feature/idea and a rationale for the feature/idea. The Council member authoring and submitting the DIP is responsible for building consensus within the community and the rest of the council to seek a majority consent during the voting rounds, should the DIP progress to the latter stages.

Any dissenting opinions by the other council members during the discussion phase of the DIP should be documented so a clear pattern can be devised for Dijets to establish a streamlined proposal submissions process.

The purpose of this process is to ensure that any changes to Dijets are fully transparent, well documented and well governed by Dijets Governance Council. Furthermore the proposals should all adhere to a set standard of acceptable parameters.

# DIP Rationale:

DIPs are meant to be the primary mechanism for proposing new features and or submitting an enhancement/improvement idea or to rectify any overlooked issues. Eventually the aim is to have a strong foundation for documenting all the design decisions that have gone or will go into Dijets. A text format copy of the DIPs will be maintained as in a versioned repository, allowing the changelog to act as a record of the proposal.

# Types of DIPs:

1. Blue DIP
- The very first form of a DIP. Blue DIPs are DIPs mainly for informational purposes only. 
The information contained within the Blue DIP can range from design issues, to providing general guidelines or information to Dijets users and community etc 
This DIP is neither for proposing any new features nor for making a call to the Treasury Wallet. This form can also be considered as a temperature check by the council if the information contained within tbe DIP relates to an issue that must be escalated to the Amber DIP status.

2. Amber DIP
- Amber DIP is submitted by a council member to propose a design system change or an enhancement or improvement strategy relating to any of Dijets Products and services within the Ecosystem. An Amber DIP requires a mandatory discussion between the members to discuss the validity, urgency and the benefits of the proposal. 
An Amber DIP can be submitted to make a change or addition that affects Dijets Governance itself. This proposal type has a capped limit call of < 10,000 DJTX to the Treasury Wallet. Members must vote at the end of a review period for each submitted Amber DIP.

3. Green DIP
- Green DIP includes improvements around client API/RPC specifications and standards. Green DIPs must always be co-signed by a member from Dijets Core Team before its presentation and publication in the DIP repo. Members are free to propose changes and/or improvements to application-level standards and conventions, including contract standards, listings for Dijetex, ICO Launchpads etc.
Green DIPs have a capped limit call of <50,000 DJTX to the Treasury Wallet.

# DIP Lifecycle Stages:

The Amber and Green DIPs both undergo the following lifecycle before being published to the Dijets Improvements Repository as an official Proposal Submission accredited to the authoring Council Member.
