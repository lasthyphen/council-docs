## Membership Requirements

Dijets Council members are selected through various considerations such as knowledge about Blockchain, background, merit, interest, and a willingness to commit to Dijets Network and Ecosystem.

Each council member goes through the following steps before being added on-chain as a verified governance council member.

## 1. Submit a Member Profile Questionnaire
- By submitting a member profile questionnaire, prospective council members can elaborate on their knowledge, skillset and background for consideration.

## 2. Generate a Singleton Wallet
- Council Members are required to generate a Singleton Wallet for the purpose of transparency and for uniformity with their on-chain activities.

[How to generate a singleton wallet](/docs/guides/registration/singleton)

## 3. Generate a Node ID
- Each council member is required to fulfill his/her Node Setup requirements. This process starts with confirming their Node ID for inclusion into the Validator's set.

## 4. Stake the required 25K DJTX for 12 months
- Once Djiets Node is up and running and fully bootstrapped, Council Members can use their Node ID to stake the required 25K DJTX for the 12 months period.

## 5. Sign the DGC Manifesto
- The penultimate step in Council Member's registration is the signing of Dijets Governance Council Manifesto (DGC Manifesto) using the public key of the singleton wallet generated beforehand.

## 6. Submit a Blue DIP
